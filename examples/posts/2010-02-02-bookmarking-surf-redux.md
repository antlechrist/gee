Bookmarking for surf, redux
===========================

Following up from the previous post on surf bookmarking:

Lorenzo found a very nice solution, involving no shell scripts.
[Check it out](http://lbolla.wordpress.com/2010/01/09/surf-browser-hints-3/).

I agree with L on the not using surf thing. I look at it, mess around with it
and stuff, but I'm not geeky enough to use it full time.

L's config.h can be found on the
[suckless wiki](http://surf.suckless.org/files/simple_bookmarking_redux)
as well.
