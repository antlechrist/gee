NILE TOUR
=========

The ["Those Whom the Gods Detest Tour II"][Nile] is, per usual, not coming to
Cincinnati. The closest shows are

* November 1st in Louisville, KY at [Headliners][] (an awesome venue)
* November 6th in Cleveland, OH at [Peabody's][]

which sucks. When did good bands stop coming to Cincinnati? When they realized
that Cincinnati is a shithole. Musically, at least.

_P.S. [Math the Band][] is playing at Headliners on May 16th! Awesome!_

_P.P.S. Converge is playing there on May 26th! Cincinnati sucks donkey balls.
Horse the Band is playing Peabody's tomorrow. AAAGGGHHH!_
