WHY KEEP TRYING
===============

to work with audio on Windows? I've been running Linux and/or BSD for almost 4
years now, and never, not _once_, have I had a crash. But doing audio
production on anything but Windows/Mac is an exercise in futility at this
point, especially if you use software synthesizers and effects. It's getting
better with time, but it's still not there unless you want to do academic
noise experimentation or 'three chords and a broken heart' singer-songwriter
bullshit. So I installed Windows for the first time in a long while 6 months
ago:

iTunes ate almost my entire music collection.

**Never** on Linux/BSD have I had a userland app eat my data.

With time, I conveniently forgot the hellishness that is Windows and, seduced
by the siren song of my Superior 2.0 drums and a fat Minimoog, I installed it
again. It ran OK for three days, one of which I was booted into Slack for most
of the day, then:

Spectatcular crash [Black Screen of Death] while running REAPER with 3 tracks.
3 tracks! How can I trust this to do any _actual_ work?

I am too broke to buy a Mac. I am fooked.
