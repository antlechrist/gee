Encyclopedia: belief
--------------------
A mental attitude of acceptance or assent toward a proposition without the
full intellectual knowledge required to guarantee its truth. Believing is
either an intellectual judgment or, as the 18th-century Scottish Skeptic David
Hume maintained, a special sort of feeling with overtones that differ from
those of disbelief. Beliefs have been distinguished according to their degree
of certainty: a surmise or suspicion, an opinion, or a conviction. Belief
becomes knowledge only when the truth of a proposition becomes evident to the
believer. **Belief in someone or something is basically different from belief
that a proposition is true** _(emphasis added -A)_.
