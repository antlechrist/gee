<h1>George H. Smith&rsquo;s rebuttal of agnosticism</h1>

<p><em>Some people think this argument is fallacious</em>. GIYF.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism:_The_Case_Against_God">Atheism: The Case Against God</a> George H. Smith argues that all
agnosticism is a form of atheism (defined here as &ldquo;lacking a belief in a
deity&rdquo;). His argument against agnostic theism is that it is contradictory to
state that a being is inherently or currently unknowable, and yet positively
assert a belief in its existence. His argument is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>One cannot possibly know that something exists without some knowledge
of what it is that exists.</li>
<li>If it is declared unknowable, the concept of &ldquo;god&rdquo; becomes meaningless.</li>
<li>The agnostic theist&rsquo;s statement of belief therefore becomes equivalent
to &ldquo;a blark exists.&rdquo;

<ul>
<li>This unspecified belief (&ldquo;I believe in &lsquo;something&rsquo;&rdquo;) is equivalent
to nonbelief (&ldquo;I am not convinced by any particular religious claim&rdquo;).
Therefore the so-called agnostic theist is in fact an atheist (by being
unable to assert a positive belief in any specific deity).</li>
<li>It follows that all agnosticism is a form of atheism.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the agnostic theist still wishes to believe, he must ascribe
attributes of some sort to the belief. However, they would then be
claiming some knowledge of their deity and are therefore no longer
agnostics but are theists instead.</li>
</ul>


<p>Smith concisely describes the paradox:</p>

<blockquote><p>To posit the existence of something which, by its nature, cannot be known
to man is to submerge oneself in hopeless contradictions. &hellip;When one
claims that something is unknowable, can one produce knowledge in support of
this claim? If one cannot, one&rsquo;s assertion is arbitrary and utterly without
merit. If one can, one has accomplished the impossible: one has knowledge of
the unknowable. &hellip;The theist who is called upon to explain the content of
his belief&mdash;and who then introduces the &ldquo;unknowable&rdquo; as a supposed
characteristic of the concept itself&mdash;is saying, in effect: &ldquo;I will explain
the concept of god by pointing out that it cannot be explained.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&mdash; Smith, George H. 1974. <em>Atheism: The Case Against God,</em> 44.</p></blockquote>
