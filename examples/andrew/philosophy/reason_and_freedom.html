<h1>REASON AND FREEDOM</h1>

<p>There are, fundamentally, only &hellip;two causes which you will find at the root
of any happy, benevolent, progressive era in human history. One cause is
psychological, the other existential&mdash;or: one pertains to man&rsquo;s consciousness,
the other to the physical conditions of his existence. The first is <em>reason</em>,
the second is <em>freedom</em>. And when I say <em>&ldquo;freedom,&rdquo;</em> I do not mean poetic
sloppiness, such as &ldquo;freedom from want&rdquo; or &ldquo;freedom from fear&rdquo; or &ldquo;freedom
from the necessity of earning a living.&rdquo; I mean &ldquo;<em>freedom from
compulsion</em>&mdash;freedom from rule by <em>physical force</em>.&rdquo; Which means: <em>political</em>
freedom.</p>

<p>These two&mdash;reason and freedom&mdash;are corollaries, and their relationship is
reciprocal: when men are rational, freedom wins; when men are free, reason
wins.</p>

<p>Their antagonists are: <em>faith</em> and <em>force</em>. These, also, are corollaries:
every period of history dominated by mysticism, was a period of statism, of
dictatorship, of tyranny. Look at the Middle Ages&mdash;and look at the political
systems of today.</p>

<p>&hellip;[L]adies and gentlemen, <em>capitalism and altruism are incompatible.</em></p>

<p>Make no mistake about it&mdash;and tell it to your Republican friends: capitalism
and altruism cannot coexist in the same man or in the same society.</p>

<p>Tell it to anyone who attempts to justify capitalism on the ground of the
&ldquo;public good&rdquo; or the &ldquo;general welfare&rdquo; or &ldquo;service to society&rdquo; or the benefit
it brings to the poor. All these things are true, but they are by-products,
the secondary consequences of capitalism&mdash;not its goal, purpose or moral
justification. The moral justification of capitalism is man&rsquo;s right to exist
for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others
to himself; it is the recognition that man&mdash;every man&mdash;is an end in himself,
not a means to the ends of others, not a sacrificial animal serving anyone&rsquo;s
need.</p>

<p>&mdash; Rand, Ayn. 1960. <em>Faith and Force: The Destroyers of the Modern World</em>.</p>
