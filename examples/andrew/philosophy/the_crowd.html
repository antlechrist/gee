<h1>THE CROWD</h1>

<p>The characteristics of the reasoning of crowds are the association of
dissimilar things possessing a merely apparent connection between each
other, and the immediate generalisation of particular cases. It is arguments
of this kind that are always presented to crowds by those who know how to
manage them. They are the only arguments by which crowds are to be
influenced. &hellip;On reading certain speeches, astonishment is felt at their
weakness, and yet they had an enormous influence on the crowds which
listened to them, but it is forgotten that they were intended to persuade
collectivities and not to be read by philosophers. An [<em>orator</em>] in intimate
communication with a crowd can evoke images by which it will be seduced. If
he is successful his object has been attained, and twenty volumes of
harangues&mdash;always the outcome of [<em>reflection</em>]&mdash;are not worth the few
phrases which appealed to the brains it was required to convince.</p>

<p>&mdash; Le Bon, Gustave. 1895.
