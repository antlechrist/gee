<h1>QUOTES</h1>

<p>While most peoples' opinions change,
the conviction of their correctness never does.</p>

<p>If you flaunt it, expect to have it trashed.</p>

<p>The Seventh Commandments for Technicians:
Work thou not on energized equipment, for if thou dost, thy
fellow workers will surely buy beers for thy widow and console her in
other ways.</p>

<p>What do I consider a reasonable person to be? I&rsquo;d say a reasonable person
is one who accepts that we are all human and therefore fallible, and takes
that into account when dealing with others. Implicit in this definition is
the belief that it is the right and the responsibility of each person to
live his or her own life as he or she sees fit, to respect this right in
others, and to demand the assumption of this responsibility by others.</p>

<p>&mdash; From the Fortune Files</p>

<pre><code>* * *

<p>It is a farce to call any being virtuous whose virtues do not result
from the exercise of its own reason.</p>

<p>&mdash; Mary Wollstonecraft</p>

<p>&hellip;Yes, I would like it to happen. I live in fear <em>of</em> it happening, in the
same way that Colombian drug barons live in fear that everyone&rsquo;s going to make
cocaine legal&hellip;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Should it rain beer?&rdquo; and &ldquo;If it were to rain beer, would I be prepared to
cope with that eventuality?&rdquo; My answer is, &ldquo;Yes, it should rain beer; Yes, I
would be prepared to cope with that eventuality; No, it&rsquo;s NEVER going to
happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&mdash; Stuart Langridge</p>

<p>Democracy is a form of government that substitutes election by the incompetent
many for appointment by the corrupt few.</p>

<p>&mdash; G.B. Shaw</p>

<p>Tears flowed from my eyes like Ted Kennedy&rsquo;s bladder after nickel beers at
the Senate booze parlor.</p>

<p>&mdash; Gabriel</p>

<p>You finally made it home \ Draped in the flag that you fell for [sic].</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s fucking hopeless.</p>

<p>&mdash; Lamb of God / Ashes of the Wake</p>

<p>Naturally the common people don&rsquo;t want war&hellip; but after all it is the
leaders of a country who determine the policy, and it is always a
simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or
a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship.
Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of
the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are
being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and
exposing the country to danger. It works the same in every country.</p>

<p>&mdash; Hermann Goering</p>
