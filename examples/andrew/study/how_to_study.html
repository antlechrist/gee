<h2>1 Introduction</h2>

<p>Everyone has a different learning style. Consequently, everyone has a
different studying style. But the way that you are studying right now might
not be the best for you. How would you know? Easy: If your grades aren&rsquo;t what
you&rsquo;d like them to be, then you probably need to change how you study! <em>(Note:
Or if you feel like you aren&rsquo;t comprehending what you&rsquo;re studying. -A)</em></p>

<p>I am going to give you some suggestions on how to study efficiently. They
worked for me when I was in high school, college, and graduate school. Not
only that, but they worked equally well for me in humanities courses (like
philosophy and literature) and in science courses (like math and computer
science). But, given that everyone&rsquo;s learning style is different, some of my
suggestions may not work for you, at least not without some modifications.
Nevertheless, I urge you to <em>try</em> them. Most successful students use them (or
some slight variation of them).</p>

<h2>2 Manage Your Time</h2>

<p>School is a full-time job, and managing your time is important.</p>

<p><strong>Your education should come first!</strong></p>

<p>How much time should you devote to studying? If you assume that your education
is a full-time job, then you should spend about 40 hours/week on it. Figure
that 1 academic credit equals about 1 hour. So, if you&rsquo;re taking 15 credits,
then you&rsquo;re spending about 15 hours in class. Subtracting that from 40 gives
you 25 hours that you should be spending at home (or in the library).</p>

<p>You should spread that out over the week. 5 hours of studying per night,
Sunday through Thursday.</p>

<p>Set yourself a grade goal. If you don&rsquo;t meet it, cut down on non-school
activities.</p>

<h3>3.1 Take Notes</h3>

<p>Good studying at home begins with good notes taken in class. Just as everyone
has a different learning style, different teachers have different teaching
styles: Some teachers lecture, some lead discussions, some &ldquo;facilitate&rdquo;
individual work (as in a lab), etc. Consequently, different classroom settings
will require different note-taking techniques. But the suggestions here are
general enough to work in most situations.</p>

<h3>3.2 Take Complete Notes</h3>

<p>The key idea of taking good notes in class is to <em>write down as much as
possible</em>. There are several reasons to take notes that are as complete as
possible:</p>

<ol>
<li>It will force you to pay attention to what&rsquo;s going on in class.</li>
<li>It will keep you awake (!)</li>
<li>There will be less that you&rsquo;ll have to remember.</li>
</ol>


<p>Should you concentrate on <em>taking notes</em> or should you concentrate on
<em>understanding</em> what you are learning? Paradoxically, I&rsquo;d err on the side of
taking notes, not understanding! <em>(Note: Brian Harvey disagrees. -A)</em>
Understanding can come later, when you review your notes. But if you have
incomplete notes, it will be hard for you to learn what you didn&rsquo;t take notes
on.</p>

<h3>3.3 Use Abbreviations</h3>

<p>Taking complete notes will require you to write fairly quickly and, as a
consequence, to <em>use abbreviations</em>. Here are some that I use (many of which I
borrowed from other students and teachers), to give you an idea of how you can
abbreviate.</p>

<h2>Abbreviation &ndash; Meaning</h2>

<p>betw   &ndash; between</p>

<p>ccpt   &ndash; concept</p>

<p>cd     &ndash; could</p>

<p>compn  &ndash; computation</p>

<p>compnl &ndash; computational</p>

<p>comp   &ndash; complete</p>

<p>dn     &ndash; description</p>

<p>fn     &ndash; function</p>

<p>h.     &ndash; human</p>

<p>&hellip;g   &ndash; &hellip;ing</p>

<p>contg  &ndash; continuing</p>

<p>&hellip;l   &ndash; &hellip;al</p>

<p>compnl &ndash; computational</p>

<p>lg     &ndash; language</p>

<p>mn     &ndash; mean</p>

<p>mng    &ndash; meaning</p>

<p>&hellip;n   &ndash; &hellip;tion</p>

<p>abbrvn &ndash; abbreviation</p>

<p>NB:    &ndash; note / note well / nota bene</p>

<p>pn     &ndash; proposition</p>

<p>prop   &ndash; property</p>

<p>re     &ndash; about</p>

<p>reln   &ndash; relation</p>

<p>qn     &ndash; question</p>

<p>&hellip;r   &ndash; &hellip;er</p>

<p>compr  &ndash; computer</p>

<p>shd    &ndash; should</p>

<p>s.t.   &ndash; something / sometimes (context should make it clear)</p>

<p>stmt   &ndash; statement</p>

<p>thot   &ndash; thought</p>

<p>w/     &ndash; with</p>

<p>w/o    &ndash; without</p>

<p>wd     &ndash; would</p>

<p>wh     &ndash; which</p>

<p>&#x2227; &ndash; and</p>

<p>&#x2228; &ndash; or</p>

<p>&#x00AC; &ndash; not</p>

<p>&#x22C4; &ndash; possible / possibly</p>

<p>&#x25A1; &ndash; must / necessary / necessarily</p>

<p>&#x2200; &ndash; all / for all / every</p>

<p>&#x2203; &ndash; some / there is / there are / there exists</p>

<p><em>(Note: Check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_logic_symbols">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_logic_symbols</a> for
more unicode logic symbols. -A)</em></p>

<h3>3.4 Neatness Doesn&rsquo;t Count</h3>

<p>Yet another key idea of note-taking is that you don&rsquo;t have to be <em>neat</em>; you
only have to be <em>legible enough</em> to be able to read your notes a few hours (or
at most, a few days) later.</p>

<h3>3.5 Ask Questions and Make Comments</h3>

<p>If you have a question or something comes to mind as you&rsquo;re taking notes, you
have two choices:</p>

<ol>
<li>You can contribute to the class discussion by asking your question or making
your comment.</li>
<li>You can jot your question or comment down in your notes.</li>
</ol>


<p>I suggest always doing the latter, but also doing the former as often as
possible. The latter, so you won&rsquo;t forget it; you can always bring it up
later. Another reason, of course, is that if you <em>do</em> bring it up in class, it
should thereby become part of the day&rsquo;s class notes! One technique I use to
distinguish my own questions or comments from the rest of the notes is to put
them in the margin and/or surround them with big, bold square brackets like
so:</p>

<pre><code>+--           --+
|               |
|   like this   |
|               |
+--           --+
</code></pre>

<p>By the way, if you have a question, especially if you need clarification of
something the teacher said or wrote (possibly because it was inaudible or
illegible), <em>ask it</em>! Do <em>not</em> be embarrassed about asking it!</p>

<h3>3.6 Copy Your Notes at Home</h3>

<p>Notice that this section is titled &ldquo;Take Notes in Class and <em>Rewrite</em> Them at
Home&rdquo;; <em>not</em> &ldquo;Take Notes in Class and <em>Study</em> Them at Home&rdquo;. Of course you
should study your notes at home; but just (re-)<em>reading</em> them is too passive.
One of the themes of this guide is that studying must be <em>active</em>. It is all
too easy when <em>just</em> reading passively to have your mind wander or even to fall
asleep.</p>

<p>Moreover, notes are often incomplete or sketchy; just reading such notes won&rsquo;t
help. A few days or months afterwards, they may be illegible or
incomprehensible. Finally, if you don&rsquo;t do something active with your notes,
you run the risks of having unorganized notes or misplacing them.</p>

<p>What I suggest is that you <em>study your notes by re-writing them</em>. For each
class, buy a separate notebook from the one in which you take your notes. I
recommend a &ldquo;composition&rdquo; or spiral notebook rather than a looseleaf notebook
for your &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; (i.e., re-written) notes. Then, as soon as possible after
class (preferably that evening or the next), copy your notes into your
permanent notebook.</p>
