GEE - site generation tool
==========================

gee is a site generation tool based on genosite.  Inspired by working with
sw, werc, and vee.

* [genosite](http://hg.suckless.org/genosite)
* [sw](http://nibble.develsec.org/sw.cgi/projects/sw.md)
* [vee](http://www.0x743.com/vee/)
* [werc](http://werc.cat-v.org/)

The main development site is

    http://github.com/antlechrist/gee

but there is a Mercurial repo at

    http://bitbucket.org/antlechrist/gee

if you're into that kind of thing.  I really dislike bitbucket though, so it
isn't _as_ up to date.
